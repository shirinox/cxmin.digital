# Getting started

I'm Cosmin and this is my first blog explaining my whole a-to-z experience on learning a new language. In the first week my main checkpoints were learning Rust's syntax, learaning how to do basic things such as math, printing to console & defining types as I knew Rust is a strongly typed language before commiting to learning it.

My main learning material was [Rust's official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) which guided me through essential basic concepts about the language. I recommend following the same path if you're willing to learn Rust by reading & applying what you've learned afterwards. Rust also offers a "learn by examples" book which you can check out [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!);
}
```

The first program I've made and the most famous one is of course **Hello World**, learning how to print to the screen. This was very basic, but hey we all have to start somewhere :)

Upon reading the documentation further I've learned more about declaring variables, mutability & control flow. Here's a code snippet:

```rust
fn main() {
    // by default all variables are declared as immutable
    let two = 2;

    // mut keyword enables mutability on variables
    let mut number = 5;
}
```

Moving onto data types, I learnt about types such as **Tuples**, a type which Javascript doesn't have, so this was new to me. I caught on pretty quickly and continued learning more about how **Strings, Arrays and Numbers** work so I can get used to it.

As my first **challange** I made a fibonacci n-th number generator program which turned out to be easier than I expected. I took an easier approach by actually adding together the numbers up to the n-th number instead of using the general formula for the n-th number as I felt that it would be easier this way. Here's the code:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Fibonacci Number");
    println!("Please select an n-th value:");
    let mut a: u128 = 0;
    let mut b: u128 = 1;
    let mut n = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut n).expect("Failed reading line.");
    let mut n: u128 = n.trim().parse().expect("Please input a number.");
    let res = {
        while n != 0 {
            n -= 1;
            let t: u128;
            t = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = t;
        }
        a
    };
    println!("The number is: {res}")
}
```

Rust seems like a pretty neat language which can really help with productivity in my opinion. For now, I've moved onto learning structs and collections so I'll definetly make a blog post about those in the near future.
